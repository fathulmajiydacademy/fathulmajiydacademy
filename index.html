            <h2>Our History</h2>
                <h3>History of Our School</h3>

<p>Our school was established in December 2012 with a vision to provide both Western and Islamic education to young minds within our community. Starting humbly with five dedicated teachers and one coordinator. 
<p><strong>The team comprised:</strong></p>
          <ul class="staffList">
            <li>M. Abdullahi Umar as the Headteacher</li>
            <li>Sani Ismail as his assistant</li> 
            <li>M. Abubakar Muhammad</li> 
            <li>M. Yusuf Muhammad</li> 
            <li>M. Ibrahim Yunusa</li>
            <li>M. Usama Shuaibu Goma</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The school's coordination was under the able leadership of <strong><emp>Alh. Umar Abdullahi.</emp></strong></p>
<h3>The Beginning:</h3>
<p>The school initially operated with two sections:</p> 
          <ul class="sessionList">
            <li>Nursery and</li>
            <li>Primary</li> 
            <p>The two sections have been offering a comprehensive Morning Session for Western education and an Evening Session focusing on Islamic concepts. Within the first seven years, the school graduated students from Primary 4. Subsequently, recognizing the need for expanded opportunities, we introduced Primary 5, marking a significant milestone in our growth.</p>
<h3>Staff and Teaching Quality</h3>
<p>Over the years, the school has consistently prioritized recruiting qualified teachers, especially those with teaching certifications and experience. These educators have been instrumental in nurturing the potential of our pupils and upholding the schoolâ€™s mission.</p>
<h3>School Operations</h3>
<p>The school operates from Monday to Friday. From Monday to Thursday, classes run from 7:30 am to 5:30 pm, while on Fridays, the school closes earlier at 11:00 am to allow for Jum'ah prayers. In the early years, Quranic memorization classes were held on Saturdays and Sundays from 7:30 am to 12:00 noon. However, these weekend sessions were later canceled, allowing both pupils and teachers to rest and recharge.</p>
<h3>School Uniform</h3>
<p>Our school uniforms reflect our values and identity. Male students wear a white inner shirt, a purple jacket, trousers, and canvas shoes. Female students are required to wear long purple hijabs, trousers, a white inner shirt, and a white head tie. These uniforms symbolize unity, discipline, and modesty among our pupils.</p>

<h3>Our Achievements</h3>
<p>Since its inception, the school has grown in stature, graduating students with notable academic excellence and strong moral character. We remain committed to fostering an environment where pupils can excel academically and spiritually.</p>

<p>This rich history is a testament to the dedication of our teachers, the support of our community, and the hard work of our pupils. As we move forward, we continue to strive for greater achievements and to uphold the vision upon which our school was founded.
